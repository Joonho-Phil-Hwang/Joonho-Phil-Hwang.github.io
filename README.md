### Welocome to my website! 

I am a 3rd year PhD student in economics at Seoul National University (SNU), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Seojeong Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/misspecifiedjay/). I am broadly interested in applied and theoretical econometrics. My current research focuses on panel data econometrics.

Abstract: We discuss efficient methods for estimating the coefficients of one-
way fixed effect and two-way fixed effect models. The estimation process is
referred to as the recursive online algorithm. Panel data expansion can occur
in two dimensions: (1) by adding a new individual with some time periods to
the dataset, and (2) by adding additional time periods for an existing individual.
We address these scenarios and derive regression estimators for both one-way
and two-way fixed effects models.
