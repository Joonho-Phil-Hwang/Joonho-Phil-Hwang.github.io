## Bio

I am a 3rd year PhD student in economics at Seoul National University (SNU), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Seojeong Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/misspecifiedjay/). I am broadly interested in applied and theoretical econometrics. My current research focuses on panel data econometrics. You can find my CV of pdf version here.
