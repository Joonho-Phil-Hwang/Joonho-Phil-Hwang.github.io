### Welcome to my website! 

My name is Joonho (Phil) Hwang(황준호; 黃俊晧), a 3rd year PhD candidate in economics at Seoul National University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Seojeong Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/misspecifiedjay/). I am interested in econometrics with a focus on panel data and causal inference.

  <em>Abstract</em>: We discuss online estimation methods for commonly used linear fixed effects models in panel data. Due to the huge dataset or confidential issues, researchers may not be able to store and access entire historical data. In this paper, we propose online updating procedure of fixed effects estimators with memory efficiency. Panel data expansion can occur in two dimensions: (1) new individual with time periods, and (2) new time periods for an existing individual. We address these scenarios and derive regression estimators for fixed effects models.
